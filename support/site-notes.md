# Website Notes

Our non-profit colors are pretty much a light blue and orange. I've attached the logo media that we have and hope that's helpful. I really like the idea that the PROS logo was created to emphasize the hope that we will strive to bring to patient advocacy groups and I have a photo of a blue sky that am hoping to use as an initial welcome picture of our landing page. I've included that in the email and just let me know if you don't think we can use it.

Could the main picture have rotating text so that we could put maybe two different rare disease facts? This is a great example of that and it looks clean and fresh, I think: [http://www.sobi.com/](http://www.sobi.com/)

Was hoping that the middle of the landing page (or where you think it would look best, would have the following verbiage:

Patient Organizations can play an important role in the development of treatments for rare diseases. They can help in the design of the right study, increasing its likelihood of success, as well as expediting the drug development process.

When a Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, or Academic group ("Sponsor") embarks on a clinical development program for a _common_ disease, there is typically a wealth of information in the literature and trials conducted previously to use in designing a trial. Information is readily available about disease progression, appropriate endpoints, timing of endpoints, etc. With a rare disease, and even more so with an ultra-rare disease, there is often very little information available to aid in study design. Sponsors may have two options: 1) running natural history studies to gather sufficient information to adequately design the trials, which can add several years to the clinical development program, or 2) Proceeding with a clinical trial based on limited data, increasing the chance that the studies will fail. Patient organizations that are able to collect data from patients over time prior to the start of a clinical development program can significantly increase the chances of success of a drug development program.

These are the "columns"; and possibly they'll look nice centered across the top?:

 This is the landing page for the site. At the top right, would have a Search button and on the bottom right it would have all the social media icons that we belong to (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn so far) and a donate button. Then, the bottom center will have the Global Genes Foundation Alliance Badge and the GuideStar Silver Badge. There could be other badges as we strive to get more recognition. [https://www.salsalabs.com/](https://www.salsalabs.com/) is a great example of how the circular shaped social media logos and bottom portion (that contains badges and address) of the webpage appear. I would like the bottom left to mimic the way they've done the address and logo.   The lines that appear below the logo are:

 ```
 Pathways for Rare and Orphan Studies
 6005 Hidden Valley Road, Suite 170
 Carlsbad, CA 92011
```

Here are the various paths of the social media and let me know if I need to provide something else instead (the only one am not certain about is LinkedIn as have no idea if that path leads people to the page:
